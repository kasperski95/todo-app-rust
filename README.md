## Todo app in Rust



This project is a result of my journey in learning Rust. The following were my learning objectives and goals for this project:
- Understanding the borrow checker
- Defining a Command Line Interface
- Separating the business logic from Input/Output operations
- Creating an E2E test

The project includes a basic implementation of a Todo app that allows users to add and list items, as well as remove them. The app uses JSON as the storage format.
